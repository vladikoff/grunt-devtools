# grunt-devtools

> Grunt integration with Chrome Dev Tools

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-devtools --save-dev
```

One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-devtools');
```

## The "devtools" task

Run `grunt devtools` and open the [Grunt Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grunt-devtools/fbiodiodggnlakggeeckkjccjhhjndnb?hl=en) extension
